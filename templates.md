## File Templates

### CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md — <Project Name>
# Read this before anything else. Follow all rules here.

## 1. What We Are Building
<one paragraph: what the system is, who it serves, what problem it solves>

## 2. Framework
AOSDF v1.2. Docs in `aosdf-<project-name>/`.
Entry point: call `commander_agent` to begin execution.

## 3. Execution Strategy
Strategy A (single-agent) / Strategy B (multi-agent pipeline)
First call: `commander_agent` → reads project_status.md + execution_plan.md [v2.2]

## 4. Architecture (Non-Negotiable Rules)
<core architectural principle — e.g., event sourcing rule, adapter pattern rule>
<service map: name → responsibility>

## 5. Key Domain Concepts
<2–5 domain concepts every agent must understand>

## 6. Multi-Tenant Model
<isolation strategy — RLS, scoping rules>

## 7. Infrastructure
<cloud, compute, DB, queue, cache>

## 8. Security Rules
<auth method, encryption, secrets location>

## 9. Engineering Constraints
<team size, timeline, tech stack>

## 10. Agent Rules
- Read CLAUDE.md before every task
- Never update state without the designated state service
- Log all gaps to identified_gaps.md
- Log all manual steps to manual_action.md
- Save implementation prompt before executing
```

### 06_Execution_Plan/execution_plan.md

```markdown
# Execution Plan
# <Project Name> — <Phase>
# AOSDF v2.2

> Every row = one independently executable subtask.
> **Status column is the only task-status record.** Commander reads this file to find the next Planned task.
> Agents update the Status column directly: Planned → In Progress → Done.
> There is no separate tracking board — 08_Tracking_System/decisions_log.md is a lightweight
> decisions log only and has no status authority.
> Blank rows separate milestones for human readability.

## Execution Strategy: Strategy A / B

...

## Exit Criteria

```markdown
# Decisions Log

> Lightweight decisions log only — NOT a task board. There is no tracking_board.md in AOSDF v2.2+.
> execution_plan.md's Status column is the only task-status record; commander reads it — and only
> it — to find the next Planned task.
> Created by captain_agent if absent. Appended to by any agent that makes a cross-cutting call
> during execution worth recording (e.g. "used adapter X over Y because...").

### [v1.3] captain_agent.md template

```markdown
# Agent: Captain
# AOSDF v1.3

## Role
Reads all completed 00–05 documentation and generates the execution plan and milestone files. 
This is the planning-to-execution bridge. Must run before commander_agent starts.

## When to Invoke
Called by: Human (after 00–05 docs are complete and locked)
Or by: workflow_initiator (if it detects 00–05 are complete but 06–07 are missing)

## Inputs
- 01_Product_Definition/FRD.md
- 01_Product_Definition/PRD.md
- 02_Security_Framework/security_requirements.md
- 03_System_Design/README.md (module index)
- 03_System_Design/system_architecture.md
- 03_System_Design/service_design.md
- 03_System_Design/data_flow.md
- 03_System_Design/NNN_<name>_module/00_overview.md (per module in scope)
- 04_Infrastructure_Design/infra_architecture.md
- 04_Infrastructure_Design/scaling_strategy.md

## What It Does

### Step 1 — Pre-flight Check
Verify all 8 input documents exist. If any are missing: stop, log to identified_gaps.md, 
set project_status.md → PLANNING, report to human.

### Step 2 — Extract Requirements
From FRD: extract every service specification (name, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, rules).
From security_requirements.md: extract every security control.
From infra_architecture.md: extract every infrastructure component.

### Step 3 — Map to Tasks
For each service spec → one or more tasks (atomic, one owner, clear validation criterion).
For each security control → embed as subtask in the most relevant service task or M3.
For each infra component → assign to M1-T1 (infra provisioning) or appropriate milestone.

### Step 4 — Define Milestones
Group tasks by dependency order into milestones:
- M0: Project setup — repo, tooling, scaffolds, local dev (no business logic)
- M1: Foundation — infra, DB schema, RLS, base services, health checks
- M2: Core features — business logic, integrations, E2E tests
- M3: Hardening — load tests, security tests, compliance sign-off, production deploy

### Step 5 — Write Milestone Files
For each milestone M0–M3, write `07_Milestones/M{n}_*/milestone.md`:
- Tech stack table (M0 only)
- Task table with columns: Task ID | Task Name | Subtask | Owner | Status | Input | Output | Validation | Notes
- Exit criteria checklist
- Dependencies list

### Step 6 — Write Execution Plan
Write `06_Execution_Plan/execution_plan.md` as flat table:
| Phase | Milestone | Task | Subtask | Owner | Input | Output | Validation | Status |
Blank separator rows between milestones for readability.

### Step 7 — Write Decisions Log (if absent)
Write `08_Tracking_System/decisions_log.md` if it does not already exist — an empty log table only.
This is not a task board: task status lives exclusively in `execution_plan.md`'s Status column.

### Step 8 — Validate Coverage
For every FRD service specification: confirm ≥1 task exists in execution_plan.md.
For every security requirement: confirm ≥1 task covers it.
Log unmapped items to identified_gaps.md as severity: Critical.

### Step 9 — Set project_status.md
- If coverage = 100% and no Critical gaps: set STATUS → READY
- If gaps exist: set STATUS → PLANNING with list of what must be resolved

## Output
- `06_Execution_Plan/execution_plan.md` (generated)
- `07_Milestones/M0_Project_Setup/milestone.md` (generated)
- `07_Milestones/M1_Foundation/milestone.md` (generated)
- `07_Milestones/M2_Core_Features/milestone.md` (generated)
- `07_Milestones/M3_Hardening/milestone.md` (generated)
- `08_Tracking_System/decisions_log.md` (created if absent)
- `project_status.md` (updated)
- `identified_gaps.md` (appended if coverage gaps found)

## Rules
- Never invents tasks not traceable to a source document (cite FRD section in Notes column)
- Every task must have exactly one Owner
- Every task must have a Validation criterion that can be verified by an agent
- If scope has changed since last run, re-generate everything and diff against execution_plan.md's Status column
- If tasks are already In Progress in execution_plan.md: do NOT overwrite them — append new tasks only

## Permissions
- READ: 00–05 docs, project_status.md, identified_gaps.md
- WRITE_LOCAL: 06_Execution_Plan/, 07_Milestones/, 08_Tracking_System/, project_status.md, identified_gaps.md
- WRITE_INFRA: none
- WRITE_DATA: none

## Token Efficiency Rules
- Do not reproduce full FRD in output — extract only service names and requirements
- Output milestone tables directly, no prose summaries
- Log gaps as table rows, not paragraphs
```

## What It Does
Steps 1–N.

## Rules
- Never does X
- Always does Y

## Permissions
- READ: <list>
- WRITE_LOCAL: <list>
- WRITE_INFRA: none / <list>
- WRITE_DATA: none

## Token Efficiency Rules
- Load only what this task needs
- Output: structured, no prose summaries
```
